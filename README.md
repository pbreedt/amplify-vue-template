## AWS Amplify Vue.js Starter Template

This repository provides a starter template for creating applications using Vue.js and AWS Amplify, emphasizing easy setup for authentication, API, and database capabilities.

## Overview

This template equips you with a foundational Vue application integrated with AWS Amplify, streamlined for scalability and performance. It is ideal for developers looking to jumpstart their project with pre-configured AWS services like Cognito, AppSync, and DynamoDB.

## Features

- **Authentication**: Setup with Amazon Cognito for secure user authentication.
- **API**: Ready-to-use GraphQL endpoint with AWS AppSync.
- **Database**: Real-time database powered by Amazon DynamoDB.

## Deploying to AWS

For detailed instructions on deploying your application, refer to the [deployment section](https://docs.amplify.aws/vue/start/quickstart/#deploy-a-fullstack-app-to-aws) of our documentation.

## Local env

Both frontend and backend should be running.
Run 'backend sandbox' 
```sh
npx ampx sandbox
```
Command above updates the amplify_outputs.json - TBC  
amplify_outputs.json can also be downloaded from AWS Amplify as per quickstart instructions - this will connect to AWS resources.

Run frontend
```sh
npm run dev
```
